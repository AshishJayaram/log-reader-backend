## Design Decisions

Modular Architecture
Each feature is encapsulated (logs controller, service, entity)

 SQLite + TypeORM
Easy to set up, inspect (logs.db)
Entity-based mapping with LogEntry
Timestamp stored as string to match log file format


## Assumptions
Log format is strictly:
[timestamp] [VEHICLE_ID:x] [LEVEL] [CODE:x] [message]
timestamp is stored as string but always ISO-compatible
Large log files are not chunked â€” handled in-memory before batch save
Sorting is primarily based on timestamp
Pagination defaults to page=1&limit=10
